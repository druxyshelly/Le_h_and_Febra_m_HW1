        <p>I'm Mazz, (derived from <i>Mars</i>, which in turn is short for Marianne) and I'm an international student currently enrolled in Fanshawe's IDP3 Program. There's nothing particularly striking about myself, but I'll let you know a couple of things:</p>

<ul>

<li>
    <a href="#" class="nes-badge">
        <span class="is-success">FSU CLASS REP</span>
      </a> <br> I'm a class rep for the Winter semester. I volunteered for this position since I'm somewhat of fixer-upper and dedicated extrovert. I like listening to other people talk, so sitting down with me might turn into an hour of endless chatting.</li> <br>

<li>
    <a href="#" class="nes-badge">
        <span class="is-primary">CREATIVE AT HEART</span>
      </a> <br> I love everything related to the arts, design and technology. I've always wanted to see these installations in person: Es Devlin's light shows, TeamLab's exhibitions and Takashi Murakami's gallery.</li> <br>

<li>
    <a href="#" class="nes-badge">
        <span class="is-error">RESTORATION RELAXATION</span>
      </a> <br> While I may not be exactly future engineer material, I do like seeing the process of how things are made. Recently, I've started binge-watching restoration videos of antiques and collectors' items. It gives me intense satisfaction to see things put back into order and given new life.</li>
  
</ul>
        
<p>Have I already mentioned that I'm planning to start a student club with my friend, Hari? It's going to be a collaborative space wherein up-and-coming student designers, developers and artists can freely exchange ideas and remain connected even until they become professionals. The idea behind this initiative is to answer the current lack of representation and organized design activities within Fanshawe; it is our hope that through our efforts, the benefits that this group provides will continue to be enjoyed by those who come after us.</p>

<p>What else is there to know about me? Well I have a younger brother, and I spent some time living in Sydney, Australia before deciding to move all the way out here to London, Ontario. I'll tell you all about my hometown some other time, preferably when it's time to make another html file out of it. For now, here's a picture of our indoor cats, Bruce & Bob.</p>

<div class="row">
    
    <div class="column"><img src="img/crackhead_bob.JPG" alt="Crackhead Bob" width="500px" height="auto"></div>

<div class="column">
<video width="500" height="750" autoplay muted>
<source src="assets/landlord.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>

<div class="column"><img src="img/grumpy_bruce.JPG" alt="Grumpy Bruce" width="500px" height="auto"></div>


</div>

<p>➭ Grumpy Bruce adopted our place and has lived there ever since. He's not exactly chirpy about the recent living conditions: Crackhead Bob loves exhausting his patience and pissing him off (what else are kittens for?) but still, I love them both. They make life tolerable.</p>
