# Welcome to our Main Branch! 
###### Actually it's our GitHub assignment that we finally got to work (properly). Stick around to see our submitted files; you might learn a thing or two about us. ~~Just two broke girls figuring this out.~~ What was that? Do we have similarities with each other? Well we both got our hair done some time ago but one's the shade of lavender and the other's the color of Tim Tams. Highly doubt we can afford the same services anytime soon :') 

# GitHub Collaboration 
###### We teamed up because quiet frankly, _two heads are better than one._ Outside of that, we also had help from some of our more experienced classmates. The most difficult part of getting used to GitHub is the terminology: it was impossible to picture what exactly our commands were 'committing' out there, in the imaginary void of coding space.

`Below you will find brief descriptions of the two of us. Make sure to check out our own branches for our individual READMEs! God only knows what else you'd find.`

## About Mazz
