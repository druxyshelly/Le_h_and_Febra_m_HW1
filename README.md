# Welcome to our Main Branch! 
###### Actually it's our GitHub assignment that we finally got to work (properly). Stick around to see our submitted files; you might learn a thing or two about us. ~~Just two broke girls figuring this out.~~ What was that? Do we have similarities with each other? Well we both got our hair done some time ago but one's the shade of lavender and the other's the color of Tim Tams. Highly doubt we can afford the same services anytime soon :') 

# GitHub Collaboration 
###### We teamed up because quiet frankly, _two heads are better than one._ Outside of that, we also had help from some of our more experienced classmates. The most difficult part of getting used to GitHub is the terminology: it was impossible to picture what exactly our commands were 'committing' out there, in the imaginary void of coding space.

`Below you will find brief descriptions of the two of us. Make sure to check out our own branches for our individual READMEs! God only knows what else you'd find.`

## About Hari
> Attempting this for the first time!

> I'm looking forward to studying in this term and it's such an honor to meet you guys in Canada but not elsewhere. My name is Ha Anh, but you can call me Hari since it's easier to read. I'm 18 years old and come from Vietnam so if you are interested in Vietnamese food, do you want to go eat Pho with me? Then let me introduce a bit about myself.

> First of all, I love to hang out and get to know lots of people because I want to broaden my friends circle to gain knowledge about different cultures around the world.

> Secondly, I am a music lover. I listen to many types of music but mostly RnB, and even K-pop, US/UK, Chinese or Japanese songs. I cannot live without music since it heals my soul and helps me express feeling which I can't say.

> Moreover, I also have a cat whose name is Do which means dollar in English. My mom gave it to him so that he could help us earn money :)))). Besides, I would like to bring him to Canada soon, or else I'm going to miss him so badly.
